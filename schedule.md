All readings are from Computer Systems, a programmer’s perspective, by Randal E. Bryant and David R.
O’Hallaron unless otherwise stated.

This semester, the intended flow of a week of class is this:

*  Throughout the week: there will be assigned readings, video lectures, and discussion questions.
*  Mondays: there is a synchronous, online, required lab session with a short activity and a
   Gradescope quiz based on that activity **due on that day at 5pm**. Check your schedule for the
   time of your lab session; the lab will take place via Blackboard Collaborate.
*  Tuesdays: open Q&A office hours in [MS Teams]({{site.msteams}}). Video lectures for the week
   premiere. I will keep them in [this YouTube playlist]({{site.playlist}}).
*  Thursdays: Content quizzes and discussion question responses **are due at noon**. I will go over
   discussion question answers in class. Discussion questions are **loosely** based on exam question
   style, structure, and content.

All assignment turnins are through [the course gradescope page]({{site.gradescope}}).

If I find or mention additional useful videos & web resources I'll add them to [this
google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yzSKrb-nhL_CrJ7BHqOJPN5DobB9jnDvnFG2j3k0g8/edit)
(UIC login required). Anyone can edit it so feel free to add resources you feel are helpful.
