# Lab 2: Turning in assignments

This lab is a test run for turning in the homeworks for this class, and
a test run for doing the paired lab activities for this class.
There are two main deliverables:

  1. In the Blackboard Collaborate main room, make sure your SSH keys are added to your GitHub account. Go to the [this GitHub Classroom assignment]({{page.github_link}}) and accept the invite. For evaluation, you need to complete the Gradescope assignment for the lab, and demonstrate how you did that to your peer. All course assignments are visible from the [course Gradescope page]({{site.gradescope}}). Passing the gradescope assignment will be 1/4 of your lab grade for this week.
  
  2. Once you've completed and submitted your lab on Gradescope, find your breakout room on [this sheet]({{page.pairings}}). Each tab on the sheet lists the breakout room number, the UIC email of the evaluator and the evaluatee for the respective lab sessions. In your break out room, screen share with your evaluator and show them that you are able to
   execute the homework submission workflow. You receive one point for
   each of:
      * Can clone a clean copy of their assignment GitHub repository using
     ssh without typing a password (this means use the repository link
     will be of the format
     `git@github.com:ckanich-classrooms/week-2-lab-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git`)
     * Can make a change, commit it, and push it (again no password
     typing).
     * Can Navigate to the course Gradescope page and upload those
     changes (this upload goes through GitHub, not your local machine).
3. When you are the evaluator, it's your responsibility to watch the
   other student perform the steps in #2. If they get stuck on a
   specific thing, you can give them hints, help them out a bit, but not
   do it for them/straight up tell them the answer. For this assignment,
   they receive one point for the clean ssh copy without a password, one
   for committing and pushing a change, and one for uploading that new
   code to Gradescope, for a total of 3 points. Once they finish you
   must record their score via [this form](page.eval_link).


<!-- When lab starts, you can look at [this page](page.pairings) to see who you will evaluate.  -->
There will be an "A" and a "B" evaluation: A runs
from :30-:40 past the hour of your lab session, and B runs from :40-:50.

If your evaluator or evaluatee isn't in lab, contact the TA and they
will either pair you up with someone else or evaluate you.
