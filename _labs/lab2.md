# Lab 2: Turning in assignments

This lab is a test run for turning in the homeworks for this class, and
a test run for doing the paired lab activities for this class.
There are two main deliverables:
1. Complete the Gradescope based programming assignment for the lab. All
   course assignments are visible from the [course Gradescope page]({{
   site.gradescope }}).
2. Screen share with your evaluator and show them that you are able to
   execute the homework submission workflow.

TODO: Give more details on what this lab entails.
