# What even _is_ the Internet?

About 14 years ago a senator from Alaska went to the senate floor and explained the Internet to
folks and said that "The Internet is not something that you just dump something on, it's not a big
truck.. It's a series of tubes!" and I think about that speech a lot. There are a whole lot of other
choice quotes, but actually, completely out of context, it's basically true! The Internet really is
a series of tubes.

To be just slightly more specific, the Internet as we know it today is a mishmash of a lot of really
_amazing_ ideas, that all came together at the right time in the right way, through a lot of insight and hard work on
the part of lots of scientists, engineers, and even policymakers. Even Al Gore, who [really
does](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/) deserve credit for helping get
the Internet off the ground).

So these ideas - there's no way of getting around the fact that there are a lot of them. Properly
learning the way the Internet works takes a whole class ([CS 450 to be
exact!](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/cs450/s18/)), but the intention of this page is to be a
mini-unit on "the design decisions that really made the Internet awesome," and just enough
explanation to give you an idea of what they are and why they're important.


## Separation of concerns and "the thin waist"

So say you're going to connect a lot of computers.

Like a lot of computers.

I mean a LOT of computers.

This is so many computers that 

## Packet switched networking


## Distributed congestion control

# What's so **hard** about building an Internet?
	• Two generals problem (reliability)
	• Requirements: 
		○ Reliability, but also…
		○ Transport
		○ Addressing
		○ naming
		○ routing
	• Wildly different networking technologies
		○ Scalability of a global system (naming, routing, reliability)
	• A network vs. an internet
	• Bandwidth, latency, error rate



The ideas that built the modern Internet
