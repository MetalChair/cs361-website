# Schedule Overview

This semester, the intended flow of a week of class is this:

1. Throughout the week: there will be assigned readings, video lectures, and discussion questions.
1. Mondays: there is a synchronous, online, required lab session with a short activity and a
   Gradescope quiz based on that activity that must be completed before the end of the day.
2. Tuesdays: open Q&A office hours. 
3. Thursdays: content quizzes are due. discussion questions are due. I will go over discussion
   question answers in class. Discussion questions are **loosely** based on exam question style,
   structure, and content.

Any additional useful videos or web resources will be linked from [this
